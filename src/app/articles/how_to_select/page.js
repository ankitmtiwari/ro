                    Water purifiers have become an essential home appliance
                    because of rising pollution and unsuitable drinking water.
                    Especially in cities, where water is always polluted and
                    there is no access to groundwater or freshwater from water
                    bodies. Thus, the water purifier is no longer a luxury but a
                    necessity for every home. But buying one is not necessarily
                    an easy task. You might end up buying the wrong one if you
                    do not put your research into it. One must go for complete
                    research before he/she goes to rent or buy a water purifier.
                    Buy the best water purifier for your home using the
                    following guide.

                    Types of Impurities Present in Water
                  </div>
                  <div class="mb-2 ">
                    Bacteria, nitrate, pesticides, and lead are harmful to your
                    health, and maybe even lethal in the long term. If the salt
                    and microbe content is very high, then it is advisable to
                    shop for a UV + RO water purifier. The UV destroys bacteria
                    and viruses’ ability to multiply. At the same time, the RO
                    membrane removes these dead germs, purifies the water, and
                    makes it fit for human consumption. The best water purifiers
                    in India conquer all these kinds of impurities to provide
                    the best drinkable water.

                    What is your Water Source?
                  </div>
                  <div class="mb-2 ">
                    You need to evaluate the water that you get supplied to your
                    home to see what kind of purifier you require. The standard
                    of water differs from one area to another. Some water is
                    loaded with sediments while the next one has invisible germs
                    and viruses in it which may affect your health. Usually, the
                    physical appearance of water will indicate if there are any
                    sediments within the water. The odor and taste of water can
                    even illustrate the presence of dissolved impurities. If the
                    water leaves behind white patches when kept in a steel
                    utensil, this signifies the presence of hardness (Calcium &
                    Magnesium) in it.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In such cases, combination technology water purifiers are
                    the most suitable option for you. RO purifier contains a
                    semi-permeable membrane that contains a pore size of 0.0005
                    microns. These pores remove the tiniest of dissolved salts,
                    metals, and impurities. You’ll be able to also get your
                    water tested to determine if there are any impurities
                    present within the water. Some heavy metals like lead,
                    mercury, and arsenic present within the water can cause a
                    pathological problem. Once you recognize the standard of
                    water that gets supplied to your home, choosing the water
                    purifier is a simple task.

                    TDS of Your Water
                  </div>
                  <div class="mb-2 ">
                    TDS control stands for purification technique which controls
                    the ultimate TDS and thus the taste of the water. According
                    to W.H.O, the permissible limit of TDS in potable water
                    should be between 50-120 PPM and pH should be above 7.4. If
                    you’re getting water from the Municipal Corporation, it
                    should be under 120 TDS and you’ll be able to also choose
                    another Purifier system and not necessarily an RO purifier.
                    If you get water from bore systems, you must always choose
                    the RO system because bore water has high TDS as it travels
                    from below the surface and heavy metals get dissolved in it.

                    The best possible way to select amongst many brands of water
                    purifiers is to match their purification technology. The
                    technology utilized in water purification affects the
                    standard of water. Every water purifier has some mechanism
                    to filter the contaminated water. There are particular
                    labels for these specifications:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <li>
                      RO which stands for Reverse Osmosis treatment. RO uses a
                      semi-permeable membrane to get rid of hardness, metals,
                      ions, molecules, and bigger particles from potable water.
                      The best RO purifier should be able to get rid of all
                      unwanted particles without compromising the taste.

                    <li>
                      UV, which stands for Ultraviolet water purifier system
                      uses Ultraviolet rays to kill germs present within the
                      water.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      UF stands for Ultrafiltration. UF uses Hydrostatic
                      pressure against a tissue layer to purify bacteria and
                      viruses from water.

                        <b>Electricity:</b> The UV and RO water purifiers
                        require electricity. So if you reside in an area where
                        there’s a power cut repeatedly or insufficient
                        electricity supply, you would possibly want to choose an
                        alternate water purifier to cope up with the ability
                        cuts. An alternative one can be a UF filter.

                        Maintenance Cost: Before buying a Water Purifier or RO
                        System, you must analyze and ensure its maintenance cost
                        will suit your budget. Any water purifier needs services
                        regularly at an interval of 3-4 months and needs to
                        interchange filters each year. Maintenance of a decent
                        purifier should be under Rs.2000/- each year however
                        maintenance of the many RO purifier systems varies
                        between Rs.2000/- to 5000/- annually. We have many RO
